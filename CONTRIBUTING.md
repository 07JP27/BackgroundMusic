# Contributing

Firstly, thanks for reading this. Pull requests, bug reports, feature requests, etc. are all very welcome (including
ones from non-developers).

The code is mostly C++ and Objective-C. But don't worry if you don't know those languages--I don't either. Or Core
Audio, for that matter.

No dependencies so far, though you're welcome to add some.

The best place to start is probably `DEVELOPING.md`, which has an overview of the project and instructions for building,
debugging, etc. It's kind of long, though, and not very interesting, so you might prefer to go straight into the code.

If you've got questions related to Core Audio, the [Core Audio mailing
list](https://lists.apple.com/archives/coreaudio-api) is very useful. There's also the [Core Audio
Overview](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/Introduction/Introduction.html)
and the [Core Audio
Glossary](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/CoreAudioGlossary/Glossary/core_audio_glossary.html).
